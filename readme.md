# The story of a bear

#### The portfolio project from [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com) :
###### Build a Node.js console app that generates random messages each time a user runs the program and version your project with Git/GitHub.

#### My interpretation :
###### To create story of a bear from random sentences each time a user runs the program and version project with Git/Github.

#### Technologies used :
* **JavaScript**
* **GitBash**(or any other terminal)
* **Node.js**
* **MarkDown**(for readme text file)
* **Git/Github**(for version control)

#### Launch :
1. Download **.js** file from the repository.
1. Open your **terminal**.
1. Find the **location** of downloaded files.
1. Clear terminal with command 'clear'.
1. Recomended size: 56 x 53, but in different terminals could be different sizes.
1. Start the **Mixed_messages.js** with command **node** in terminal.
